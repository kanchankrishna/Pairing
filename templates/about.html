      Quarry Lane is unique in the sense that it equally comprises of both
      international and domestic students. However, there is an inherent gap
      between the two groups due to a lack of assimilation. This application is
      meant to bridge the gap through having any student, new or
      already-attending, enter their personal interests. My app will match them
      with someone who shares at least one thing in common.
